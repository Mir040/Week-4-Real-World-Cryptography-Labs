RSA vs AES - Summary and Use-Cases

1. Basic Differences
- RSA:
  - Asymmetric (public/private keys).
  - Good for small data (keys, signatures).
  - Slower, computationally heavy.
  - Example use: encrypting a symmetric key or verifying signatures.

- AES-256:
  - Symmetric (single shared secret key).
  - Very fast and efficient for large data.
  - Requires secure key distribution.
  - Example use: encrypt bulk data, files, and streams.

2. Typical Hybrid Pattern (Recommended in practice)
- Generate a random AES key (symmetric).
- Encrypt the large file with AES (fast).
- Encrypt the AES key with RSA using recipient's public key.
- Send both the RSA-encrypted AES key and the AES ciphertext.
- Recipient: decrypt AES key with private RSA key, then decrypt ciphertext with AES.

3. Security & Performance Notes
- RSA provides confidentiality and authentication (when used with signatures), but not efficient for large payloads.
- AES (with a secure mode like GCM or CBC+HMAC) provides confidentiality and (with AEAD) integrity.
- Use ephemeral key exchange (ECDHE) or hybrid schemes to get forward secrecy and scalable performance.
